The solution is to ensure that the `package.json` file contains a correctly configured `main` field pointing to your application's entry point.  Here's an example of a corrected `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-expo-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "App.js", // Correct main entry point
  // ... rest of your package.json
}
```

Make sure that the file specified in the `main` field exists and is the correct entry point for your React Native application. If you're using a different entry point (like `index.js`), make sure to update the `main` field accordingly.
